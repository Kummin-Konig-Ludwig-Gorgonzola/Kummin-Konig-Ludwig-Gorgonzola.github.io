    <h1>founding ☭</h1>
    <p>The republic of goddard is a micronation founded in 2022 by Tombo, Caremelised Onion Cheese, Bread Cheese and Beans Cheese. at its founding,
      they took upon the cheesanese culture and swore loyalty to the people and to the creation of a classless society. 
      from here, the departments and the initial draft of the constitution were formed, as well as the bestowment of the duty of käse kaiser and politburo.
      since then, we have grown to a mighty nation with many citizens with great roles.</p><br>
    <h1>language and local culture</h1>
    <p>"mozzarello", it means hello in one of our national languages, the language of cheesanese, which you can access the dictonary below. 
    Our other national language is english, but we have many other languages spoken within our borders. culturally, we have other systems. for example, all citizens have a cheesanese name 
    as well as an english name. for example, rafi amelines is known in cheesenese as caremelised  onion cheese.</p>

    <h1>the gouda games</h1>
    <p>
      if someone runs up to you and says "gouda mozzarellissima", you have just been pulled into the gouda games. this is where those who are caught by the gouda mozzarellissima are recorded for a bit of fun.
      to avoid being caught, simply point or say "i aknowledge your existence!" towards any participant.
    </p><br>
    <h1>time</h1>
    <h2>chabis</h2>
    <p>A chabi is a tenth of a day, and it is our main system of time in the goddard. Goddardians will likely count in decimillichabis, and they are less than the imperialist time system's seconds.</p>
    <h2>the days of the decaday</h2>
    <p>The imperialist system of a 7 day week has oppressed the people of the world, however, the working decaday helps all people, and the goddardians hope to export this new system all over the world. it goes in this order: <br>
    monday<br>
    tuesday<br>
    lokesday<br>
    wednesday<br>
    heimsday (workless day)<br>
    thursday<br>
    maniday<br>
    odesday<br>
    friday<br>
    saturday (workless day)<br>
    sunday (workless day)<br>
