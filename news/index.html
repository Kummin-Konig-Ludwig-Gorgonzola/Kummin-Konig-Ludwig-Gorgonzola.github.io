    <h1>Cyber-police new tool for preventing data-scraping</h1>
    <p>10/5/25</p>
    <p>Once upon a time, before the entrance of corporate control into the internet, common people could protect their works from the greedy interests of data scrapers hoping to make a buck from selling the common man's literary work. However, in the modern day, corporations lost all semblance of human respect for "robots.txt". As a result, the Goddardian Cyberpolice has invented minor assistance, creating a tool called zealification. Named after the way that people from New Zealand speak, zealification is a converter and accompanying font that maintains the appearance of text, but poisons the data with incorrect vowels, meaning most people using TTS can still distinguish words with a small amount of effort. See the tool below:</p>

    <p>In a controvertial new bill passed, the politburo has decided to divide the Goddardian region of mainland Goddard into 4 regions. It has yet to unveil the new flags, and has cited confusion as the leading reason. The new regions are:</p>
    <h3>a smaller mainland Goddard</h3>
    <h3>greater Cheesigrad</h3>
    <h3>algerium</h3>
    <h3>amelinia</h3>
    <br>
    <h1>New region flags introduced</h1>

    <p>22/3/2024</p>
    <p>caremelised onion cheese was resentenced from his sentence of 10 years community service to an instant demotion and being put on the no fly list. in every department besides health, he has been demoted to the lowest department possible. in addition, he is on the no fly list, so will likely never return to power. in a statement from politburo member "bread cheese", it was said "COC has come off easily, but if he commits another, he will not get off like this." COC has yet to give an answer.</p>
